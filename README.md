# Ethereum_Smart_Contract

This repo is for studying the development of blockchain applications with Ethereum. Etheruem is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. Two clients are used by a majority of nodes: Geth and Parity. I used Geth, go-ethereum, that Ethereum Foundation recommended.



### Etheruem 

Etheruem is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship fraud or third party interference. There are two clients that are used by a majority of nodes: Geth(written in Go) and Parity(written in Rust).
